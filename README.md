# Mayel Espino's Code exercises

These are exercises I do to learn a few different technologies, languages and tools. I some cases I get some code form the internet to start and in others I start from scratch or something I read. I try to references to what I used to get started, sometimes I did not and then forgot to do so later. 

I did not always do a good job of documenting and not use the best coding practices. I will retrofit these as I get a chance.

## The layout

Here is how I have organized it:

- [DATABASES](DATABASES/README.md) - Exercises to learn databases.
