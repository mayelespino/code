Wondering what the difference between a PreparedStatement and a SimpleStatement is?  Not sure what the appropriate lifetime is for a Cluster or a Session object?  What about ADO.NET and LINQ support?  We’ll cover this and more, so that you can get on with building applications on top of Cassandra.

Some of them are using Cassandra-like technologies in corners of their application landscape to learn, and perhaps as a means to lower the expenses for traditional database suppliers. So did ING. ING is now in production with Cassandra to increase scalability and availability for our channels applications.\nWe spent a year with a small team of engineers gathering experience and learning what the big shift in using this technology really means for a team and for an organization. During that time we put the first low latency data store with Cassandra in production. After many proof of concepts we are learning what needs to be done differently in the Cassandra world with an active-active setup.\nIn this session we will talk about some best practices, the shift from ACID and Relational to BASE with tuneable consistency. We will also talk about the things that we learnt including a pattern that we discovered to solve the classic “synchronization” problem in a distributed database whilst ensuring consistency.\nSome people say that this technology is not yet mature enough for use in financial services. We say that we have proven that this can be done, however it does require solid engineering skills that go beyond the obvious status quo in the IT industry. We are not there yet, but we are learning that we can balance the level of availability that our customers need with the level of consistency that the bank internally needs.",fd3f7889-fc0c-43db-951c-7b77710898bc,1ecbd956-384c-16f0-923b-961376bb53d1
