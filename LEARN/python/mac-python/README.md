# Notes

I can no longer install the objc package.

```
pip3 install objc                                                                                                                                                                                      [rc:1|h:4806]
Defaulting to user installation because normal site-packages is not writeable
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement objc (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for objc
```
