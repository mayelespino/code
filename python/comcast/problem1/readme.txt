Problem one:
* There is no need to compile this program, it's a python program.

* How to call it :
localhost:~ $ solution1 < problem1_sentences.txt

* The main idea of the solution:
- Decided to develop the program in Python because there is no need to compile and Python is platform independent. 
- Took advantage of the built infunction 'in' to search for one character in a string. The string is the phrase provided as input. The character I searched for was, one by one, the characters in the ranges of 'A' -'Z' and 'a' - 'z'
- Created two functions, one to search for all the letters in the each range, if any one is not found in the string, the function stops searching and returns False. If all the characters are found it returns True.
