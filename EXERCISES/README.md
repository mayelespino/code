# Common

These are common exercises that I write for the languages I am learning or practicing.

## Data structures

- Arrays
- Linked lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Sets
- Maps
- Binary Tree
- Heaps
-- MinHeaps
-- MaxHeaps
- Graphs

In the DataStructures folder there is one folder for each data structure, named for the data structure and language it was implemented in.


## Sorting

in the sorting folder there is one folder for each sort algorithm and language combination.

## Dynamic programing and memorization

 Dynamic programming uses recursion, so **I will not have** a separate folder for this.

In the DynamicProgramming folder there is one folder for each language used to implement. Inside each folder the program files are named for the algorithm they implement.

# Interprocess communication

inside the InterprocessCommunication folder there is a folder for each programming language used to implement.

# TBD algorithms

- Divide and conquer
- Greedy algorithms
- Graph traversal (breath and depth firsts)
