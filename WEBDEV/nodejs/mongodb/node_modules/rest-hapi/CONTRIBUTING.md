#How To Contribute

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch off of the *master* branch. Prefix your branch with either "FEATURE\_", "BUGFIX\_", or something similar describing the type of update, and then add a descriptive name such as "BUGFIX\_random\_files_erased".
3. Add your changes.
  * Please try to avoid monolithic commits. 
  * Try to follow the [Hapi Style Guide](https://hapijs.com/styleguide) as closely as possible.
4. Make sure your master branch is [in sync/up-to-date with the original](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).
5. Before submitting a pull request, merge in your synced master branch with your current branch and resolve any conflicts.
6. Once all conflicts are resolved, submit a pull request to the origin master branch.
7. Your pull request will be reviewed along with change requests or comments.
8. After all requests are complete, your pull request will be merged in.
